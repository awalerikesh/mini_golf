# Mini Golf Game

This is a 2D golf game built with **Pygame** and **Open Sound Control (OSC)** integration. The game features a side-scrolling parallax background, interactive golf physics, and sensor-based club movement.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites - Python

- Python 3.8+ [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (python package manager -> inclusive in Python 3.4+ from python.org)

### Prerequisites - OSC

To enable gyroscope-based club control, this project uses **Open Sound Control (OSC)** data streamed from a mobile device using the **Sensors2OSC** app. You’ll need the following setup:

---

#### 🧭 Step 1: Install Sensors2OSC via F-Droid

The **Sensors2OSC** app is available on **F-Droid**, a trusted platform for open-source Android applications.

1. **Install F-Droid**  
   Visit [https://f-droid.org](https://f-droid.org) and download the latest F-Droid APK to your Android device.

2. **Open F-Droid** and search for:  
   `Sensors2OSC` or visit the [Sensors2OSC app page](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sensors2osc/).

3. **Install Sensors2OSC** on your phone.

---

#### 📱 Step 2: Configure Sensors2OSC

Once installed:

1. Open the **Sensors2OSC** app.
2. Enable the **Gyroscope** sensor.
3. Under **Network Settings**, set the following:
   - **Target IP address**: `255.255.255.255`.
   - **Target Port**: `12345`.

> 💡 Make sure both your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.

#### 💻 Step 3: OSC Handler in the Game

The game runs an internal OSC server on your machine (using `python-osc`) that listens for incoming gyroscope values.

Relevant code is located in:

```python
handlers/
├── gyroscopeHandler.py     # Starts a threaded OSC server

### Game Installation - Local

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Navigate to the git folder**
3. **Install necessary packages**
4. **Launch the game**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awalerikesh/mini_golf.git
cd {path}/mini_golf
pip install -r requirements.txt
python laucher.py
